The list of the linux commands are :-

(a) ifconfig - It is used to initialize an interface, assign IP Address to interface and enable or disable interface on demand.
- "ifconfig eth0" command only shows specific interface details like IP Address, MAC Address etc. 
- "ifconfig eth0 -a" displays all the available interface details even if it has been disabled.
- "ifconfig eth0 IPADDRESS netmask GATEWAY" is used to assigning an IP Address and Gateway to the interface
- "ifup eth0" is used to enable any specific interface
- "ifdown eth0' is used to disable any specific interface
- A maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size packet or frame, specified in octets (eight-bit bytes), that can be sent in a packet- or frame-based network such as the Internet. "ifconfig eth 0 mtu ----" is used to set the MTU size
- A promiscuous mode is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that causes the controller to pass all traffic. "inconfig eth0 - promisc" sets the interface in Promiscous mode

(b) ping- It is the best way to test connectivity between two nodes.   
- "ping IPADDRESS" is used to ping the host name of that IP Address
- The ping command will keep executing until interrupted. "ping -c N IPADDRESS" will execute N times before stopping.

(c) traceroute - It is a network troubleshooting utility.
- "traceroute IPADDRESS" is used to trace rout to global DNS server IP Address and also to show the path that the packet is travelling.

(d) netstat - It displays connection info, routing table information etc.
-  netstat -rn is used to display routing table information
- netstat -a displayes all active network connections
- netstat -s displays summary statistics for each protocol that is currently running on the host

(e) dig - It is used to troubleshoot DNS related query.
- "dig IPADDRESS" is used for query DNS related information

(f) nslookup - It is also used to find out DNS related query
- "nslookup IPADDRESS" is used

(g) route - It shows the routing table and also manipulates the ip routing table.
- "route" shows the routing table
- "route add -net ....... gw ........." is used to add routes
- "route del -net ....... gw ........." is used to delete routes
- "route add default gw ........" is used to add a default gateway 

(h) host - It is used to find name to IP or IP to name in IPv4 or IPv6 and also query DNS records.
- "host website" is used to find the address
- "host -t website" is used to find out DNS resource records

(i) arp - It is useful to view / add the contents of the kernelâ€™s ARP tables. 
- "arp -e" is used to see the default table

(j) ethtool eth0 - t is to view, setting speed and duplex of your Network Interface Card
- "ethtool eth0" is used

(k) iwconfig - It is used to configure a wireless network interface. 
- "iwconfig [interface]" is used to set the basic Wi-Fi details like SSID channel and encryption.

(l) hostname - It is used to identify the host in a network
- "hostname" is used

(m) system-config-network - It is used to generate a prompt to configure network setting and a nice Graphical User Interface (GUI) which may also use to configure IP Address, Gateway, DNS etc. 
- "system-config-network" is used

(n) arp - It is used to display the content of the ARP cache
- arp -a is used
- arp -d IPADDRESS deletes the entry with the given IPADDRESS
- arp -s IPADDRESS MACADDRESS adds a static entry to the ARP cache that  is never overwritten by network events. 

(o) ip address add IPADDRESS/xx dev INTERFACE adds IPADDRESS with prefix xx to interface
- ip address del IPADDRESS/xx dev INTERFACE deletes IPADDRESS with prefix xx on interface
- ip address flush dev INTERFACE deletes all statistically assigned IP addresses for dev INTERFACE
- ip address show dev INTERFACE shows all assigned IP addresses for dev interface

(p) - echoping -v -s xxxx IPADDR pings a host with IP address IPADDR using TCP, -v is for verbose and -s is for size of packet
- echoping -v -u -s xxxx IPADDR ings a host with IP address IPADDR where -u indicates using UDP instead of TCP, -v is for verbose and -s is for packet size
